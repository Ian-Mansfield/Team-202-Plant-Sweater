# Team-202-Plant-Sweater
The plant sweater is an automatic plant cover. It makes use of a temperature sensor and photodiode to monitor ambient temperature and daylight. When it gets too cold or dark out, then it will use a motor to extend a mesh over the plant, protecting it from those conditions. 

To run this project, download both code files. The PIC code will only operate with Microchip PICS, and the IDE MPLAB X must be used. Insert the PIC code into the main.c file for the proper project. Then connect the MPLAB Snap to both your compueter and PIC, and download the code to the PIC. The ESP-32 code only works on the ESP-32, but can be run with any program that is compatable with the MicroPython language. Download the code to the ESP-32, and it should work as expected.
